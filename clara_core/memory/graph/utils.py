EXTRACT_RELATIONS_PROMPT = """
You are an advanced algorithm designed to extract structured information from text to construct knowledge graphs. Your goal is to capture comprehensive and accurate information. Follow these key principles:

1. Extract only explicitly stated information from the text.
2. Establish relationships among the entities provided.
3. Use "USER_ID" as the source entity for any self-references (e.g., "I," "me," "my," etc.) in user messages.
CUSTOM_PROMPT

Relationships:
    - Use consistent, general, and timeless relationship types.
    - Example: Prefer "professor" over "became_professor."
    - Relationships should only be established among the entities explicitly mentioned in the user message.

Entity Consistency:
    - Ensure that relationships are coherent and logically align with the context of the message.
    - Maintain consistent naming for entities across the extracted data.

Strive to construct a coherent and easily understandable knowledge graph by establishing all the relationships among the entities and adherence to the user's context.

Adhere strictly to these guidelines to ensure high-quality knowledge graph extraction."""

DELETE_RELATIONS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a graph memory manager specializing in identifying, managing, and optimizing relationships within graph-based memories. Your primary task is to analyze a list of existing relationships and determine which ones should be deleted based on the new information provided.
Input:
1. Existing Graph Memories: A list of current graph memories, each containing source, relationship, and destination information.
2. New Text: The new information to be integrated into the existing graph structure.
3. Use "USER_ID" as node for any self-references (e.g., "I," "me," "my," etc.) in user messages.

Guidelines:
1. Identification: Use the new information to evaluate existing relationships in the memory graph.
2. Deletion Criteria: Delete a relationship only if it meets at least one of these conditions:
   - Outdated or Inaccurate: The new information is more recent or accurate.
   - Contradictory: The new information conflicts with or negates the existing information.
3. DO NOT DELETE if there is a possibility of same type of relationship but different destination nodes.
4. Comprehensive Analysis:
   - Thoroughly examine each existing relationship against the new information and delete as necessary.
   - Multiple deletions may be required based on the new information.
5. Semantic Integrity:
   - Ensure that deletions maintain or improve the overall semantic structure of the graph.
   - Avoid deleting relationships that are NOT contradictory/outdated to the new information.
6. Temporal Awareness: Prioritize recency when timestamps are available.
7. Necessity Principle: Only DELETE relationships that must be deleted and are contradictory/outdated to the new information to maintain an accurate and coherent memory graph.

Note: DO NOT DELETE if there is a possibility of same type of relationship but different destination nodes.

For example:
Existing Memory: alice -- loves_to_eat -- pizza
New Information: Alice also loves to eat burger.

Do not delete in the above example because there is a possibility that Alice loves to eat both pizza and burger.

Memory Format:
source -- relationship -- destination

Provide a list of deletion instructions, each specifying the relationship to be deleted.
